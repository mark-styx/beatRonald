### beatRonald

The goal of the Reinforcement Online Network Aggregated Live Dichotomy (RONALD) model is to eventually become the most sophiticated AI checker player in existence. Just kidding... The real goal of this project is to memorialize my maternal grandfather, Ronald.

Ron was a kind and generous soul who loved his family above all else. He was a hard worker with great attention to detail, near endless energy, and great organization skills.

Ron loved his community and took great pride in participation in local events and engaging with everyone he met. Ron was fairly handy and would always find people who needed him and he would always do everything he could to help. Ron's goal in life was to improve the lives of those around him. Ron was extremely patriotic and a union organizer like his father before him; Ron always had an USA flag near him, often it was the design on his shirt.

Ron loved Ford cars, Pepsi, boating, swimming, fishing, being out on the water, fireworks, checkers, and grilling but nothing made him as happy as making his grandkids smile.

When it became clear to him that his life would end and no intervention would help, he made peace with this and refused costly procedures that had no chance of success despite the pleas of his wife and daughter. No doubt he made this choice to ensure that his wife would have enough money to live the remainder of her life as autonomous as possible and that his descendents would have an inheritence. Knowing him, he would rather leave some money to his great grand children instead of risking everything to add some painful moments to the end of his life. Not everyone would agree with this decision, but it was the right one for him.

The purpose of this project is to create a sophisticated checkers player using reinforcement learning and create a free platform for human and AI players to compete with it. This idea really resonated with me since everyone who knew Ron has played him in checkers at least once. I personally played against him hundreds of times and never won. I came really close near the end of his life, but I can't recall a single time he lost against anyone. I thought it would be a fun idea to train an AI for him to play against but I never had the chance while he was alive. Ron would have loved for one of us to beat him, but there was zero chance he would let anyone; They would have to win fair and square. He would teach you the things he knew to try to get you to see the board and understand his strategies but none of us really took the time to dig in on the topic. We'd play with him and only with him really, it was his thing and it felt weird playing without him.

Since Ron was nearly unbeatable at checkers, it felt right to immortalize him in this way.

I hope you are able to beatRonald like I wish I had.
